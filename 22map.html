                I spent countless hours on this project, which is entirely reliant on the Mapbox service. The explainer you’re reading was added to the assignment as a way of preserving the work. <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-05-08/this-roy-lichtenstein-themed-map-makes-pop-art-of-the-world" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Projects from past classes</a> were erased by a platform update, leaving their creators with nothing to show for their time and effort. 
                <br><br>Working late into the night, I began to wonder, am I putting in too much time for a final product that will ultimately vanish from the internet? Proof of all my hard work lost and no way to get it back. Why put in the time 
                with a service over which I have no real control or ownership?<br><br>
                I found an answer in the music.<br><br>
                Toward the end of <a href="https://youtu.be/pPsBFPX_yU4" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">“8 (circle)”</a>, Justin Vernon cries out <em>“I’m an astuary king.”</em> It’s a cathartic moment that encapsulates his journey through the album. Like many of his lyrics, <strong>astuary</strong> is a made-up word. It combines “<strong>aster</strong>”, the Greek root for star (think asteroid), with <strong>estuary</strong>, a place where salt and freshwater meet. I understand an astuary to be a cosmic space between things. It’s somewhere on the edge of river and ocean, past and future, life and death, yin and yang. Throughout the album, Justin is trapped in this in-between space. He oscillates between trying to hold on to what was and reaching out to what could be. 
                The anxiety and indecision overwhelm and nearly destroy him. Who among us can’t relate to his experience? I certainly did when he shared <em>22, A Million</em> with the world, having just transferred colleges and ended a relationship.<br><br>
                By declaring himself an “astuary king” near the end of the album, Justin offers a thematic conclusion to this dilemma: an acceptance of self, a peace with uncertainty, a relinquishing of control and an embrace of the present moment.<br><br>
                I found incredible joy and meaning while working on this project. I’m grateful I get to now share it with others. It will inevitably break one day, as all things do. Nothing lasts forever. Enjoy what you’ve got, while you can. Embrace the ephemeral. The first voice we hear on <em>22, A Million</em> says it better than I ever could:
                <br><br><a href="https://youtu.be/ISCEilPMNak" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">It might be over soon.</a>
